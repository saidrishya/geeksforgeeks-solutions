/*
Given two arrays A and B. Given Q queries each having a positive integer i denoting an index of the array A. For each query, your task is to
find all the elements less than or equal to Ai in the array B.

Input:
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case consists of a integer N. The second and 
third line of each test case consists of N spaced integers representing array A and array B respectively. The third line contains a positive 
integer Q, denoting the number of queries. Next Q lines contains queries.

Output: 
For each testcase, print the required answer.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 107
1 <= Ai, Bi <= 107
1 <= Q <= 103

Example:
Input:
1
6
1 2 3 4 7 9
0 1 2 1 1 4
2
5
4 
Output:
6
6

Explanation:
Testcase 1: For 1st query, the given index is 5, A[5] is 9 and in B all the elements are smaller than 9.
For 2nd query, the given index is 4, A[4] is 7 and in B all the elements are smaller than 7.
