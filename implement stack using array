/*
mplement a Stack using Array. Your task is to complete the functions below.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries . 
A Query Q is of 2 Types:
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the stack)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from stack and print the poped element)
The second line of each test case contains Q queries seperated by space.

Output Format:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers having -1 if the stack is empty else the element poped out from the stack .

Your Task:
You are required to complete two methods push which take one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the stack  and pop which returns a 
integer poped out from the stack.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100

Example:
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2
4
2 1 4 1 5 2  

Output:
3 4
-1 5

Explanation:
In the first test case for query 
1 2    the stack will be {2}
1 3    the stack will be {2 3}
2       poped element will be 3 the stack will be {2}
1 4    the stack will be {2 4}
2       poped element will be 4

The structure of the class is

    int top;
public:
    MyStack(){top=-1;}
    int pop();
    void push(int);
};

/* The method push to push element into the stack */
void MyStack :: push(int x)
{
    // if(top == 1000) return;
        arr[++top]=x;
}
/*The method pop which return the element 
  poped out of the stack*/
int MyStack :: pop()
{
              if(top == -1) return -1;
              else{
                  return arr[top--];
              }
}
