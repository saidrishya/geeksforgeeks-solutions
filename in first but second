/*
Given two arrays A and B of positive integers. Your task is to find numbers which are present in the first array, but not present in the 
second array.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains space separated integers N and M 
which denotes the number of elements in the array A and B. Next two line contains space separated array elements.

Output:
Print space separated numbers present in the first array but not in the second.
 
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, M <= 107
1 <= Ai,Bi <= 1018

Example:
Input:
2
6 5
1 2 3 4 5 10
2 3 1 0 5
5 5
4 3 5 9 11
4 9 3 11 10

Output:
4 10 
5

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 4 and 10 are present in first array while not in second array.
