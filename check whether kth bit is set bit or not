/*

Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be
indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number. Consider N = 4(100):  0th bit = 0, 1st bit = 0, 2nd bit = 1.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines
. The first line of each test case contain an integer  N. The second line of each test case contains an integer  K.

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, print "Yes" (without quotes) if Kth  bit is set else print "No" (without quotes) in a new line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
0 ≤ K ≤ floor(log2(N) + 1)

Example:
Input:
3
4
0
4
2
500
3

Output:
No
Yes
No

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 0th bit from LSB is not set. So, answer is No.
