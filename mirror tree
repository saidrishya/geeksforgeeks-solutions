/*
Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.
MirrorTree1            

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. 
The first line contains number of edges. The second line contains relation between nodes.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print inorder traversal of mirror tree.

Your Task:
You don't have to take any input. Just complete the function mirror() that takes node as paramter. The printing is done by the driver 
code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Number of nodes <= 100
1 <= Data of a node <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 R 1 3 L
4
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

Output:
2 1 3
30 10 60 20 40

Explanation:
Testcase1: The tree is
        1         (mirror)     1
     /      \         =>        /     \
   3       2                  2         3
The inorder of mirror is 2 1 3
Testcase2: The tree is
                           10                                      10
                        /        \           (mirror)         /        \
                     20         30            =>        30        20
                  /       \                                              /    \
               40       60                                        60    40
The inroder traversal of mirror is 30 10 60 20 40.
