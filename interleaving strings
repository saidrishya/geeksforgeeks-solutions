/*
Given three strings A, B and C your task is to complete the function isInterleave which returns true if C is an interleaving of A and B else 
returns false. C is said to be interleaving A and B, if it contains all characters of A and B and order of all characters in individual strings is preserved.

Input:
The first line of input contains an input T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains three space 
separated strings A, B, C.

Output:
For each test case output will be 1 if C is interleaving of string A and B else 0.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=length of A, B, C <=100

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
YX  X  XXY
XY X XXY

Output
0
1

Explanation:
1. For first test case XXY is not interleaving of YX and X
2. For the sec test case XXY is interleaving of XY and X.
