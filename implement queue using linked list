/*
Implement a Queue using Linked List.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries . 
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)
The second line of each test case contains Q queries seperated by space.

Output Format:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers having -1 if the queue is empty else the element poped out from the 
queue. 
You are required to complete the two methods push which takes one argument an integer 'x' to be pushed into the quee  and pop which
returns a integer poped out from othe queue.

Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take inputs. Just complete the provided functions. The printing is done 
automatically by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100

Example:
Input:
2
5
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2
4
1 2 2 2 1 3   
Output:
2 3
2 -1

Explanation:
Testcase1:
1 2    the quee will be {2}
1 3    the queue will be {2 3}
2       poped element will be 2 the queue will be {3}
1 4    the queue will be {3 4}
2       poped element will be 3
