/*
Given a struct array of type Height, having two elements feet and inches. Find the maximum height, where height is calculated sum of feet
and inches after converting feet into inches.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases. For each testcase, first line of input contains N, number of given heights. Next line 
contains 2*N number of elements (feet and inches for each N).

Output:
Output maximum height from array.

Your Task: Your task is to only complete the function of find maximum height from given array.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=105
0<=Feet, Inches<=105

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 2 1
4
3 5 7 9 5 6 5 5
Output:
25
93

Explanation:
Testcase 1: (1, 2) and (2, 1) are respective given heights. After converting both heigths in to inches, we get 14 and 25 as respective
heights. So, 25 is the maximum height.

int findMax(Height arr[], int n)
{
    int res=INT_MIN;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        int sum = (arr[i].feet*12)+arr[i].inches;
        if(sum > res) res=sum;
    }
return res;
}
