/*
Given a Binary Tree, find the maximum width of it. Maximum width is defined as the maximum number of nodes in any level.
For example, maximum width of following tree is 4 as there are 4 nodes at 3rd level.

          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /    \    /    \
  4    5   6    7
    \
      8

Input Format:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input.
The first line contains number of edges. The second line contains relation between the nodes.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the maximum width.

Your Task:
You don't have to read any input. Just complete the function getMaxWidth() that takes node as parameter and returns the maximum width.
The printing is done by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= edges <= 100
1 <= nodes values <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 R 1 3 L
4
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

Output:
2
2

Explanation:
Testcase1: The tree is
        1
     /      \
   3       2
The second level has 2 nodes and hence the width is 2.

Testcase2: The tree is
                           10
                        /        \
                     20         30
                  /       \
               40       60
Both second and third level have 2 nodes and hence max width is 2.
