/*
The hiring team of Google aims to find 3 candidates who are great collectively. Each candidate has his or her ability expressed as an
integer. 3 candidates are great collectively if product of their abilities is maximum. Given abilities of N candidates, find the maximum 
collective ability from the given pool of candidates.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follows. First line of each test case 
conatins an interger N  denoting the number of candidates.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated elements denoting the ablities of candidates.

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, print the desired output(maximum collective ability of three candidates) in a newline.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
3 ≤ N ≤ 107
-105 ≤ ability ≤ 105

Example:
Input
1
6
0 -1 3 100 70 50

Output:
350000

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 70*50*100 = 350000 which is the maximum possible.
