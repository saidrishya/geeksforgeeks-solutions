/*
Given a number as string(n) , your task is to complete the function remainderWith7 which returns an integer which denotes the remainder of the
number when its divided by 7. 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases then T test cases follow . Each test case contains a number
represented as string.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the remainder when the number is divided by 7.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=length of n <=300

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
5
8
Output:
5
1
