/*
Given a Binary Tree of size N, your task is to complete the function sumBt(), that should return the sum of all the nodes of the given 
binary tree.

Input:
The function takes a single arguments as input, the reference pointer to the root of the binary tree.
There are T test cases and for each test case the function will be called separately.

Output:
The function should return the sum of all the nodes of the binary tree.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 L 1 3 R
5
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R 30 90 L
Output:
