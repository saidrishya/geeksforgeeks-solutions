/*
Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number. There are several combinations 
possible. Print only first such pair. 

NOTE: A solution will always exist, read Goldbach’s conjecture. Also, solve the problem in linear time complexity, i.e., O(n).

Input:
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The following T lines consist of a number each, for which we'll find two prime numbers.

Note: The number would always be an even number.

Output:
For every test case print two prime numbers space separated, such that the smaller number appears first. Answer for each test case must be in
a new line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 70
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000

Example:
Input:
5
74
1024
66 
8
9990

Output:
3 71
3 1021
5 61
3 5
17 9973
